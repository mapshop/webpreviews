# webpreviews

This repo contains a Leaflet map and a number of geojson files. 

The map provides a way of previewing the data in the geojson files and facilitating access to downloading the same data in several other data formats.

The geojson files contain dataset collected by students in the Spring 2015 GEO 509 course.
